# example models that use the Structural Simulation Toolkit

A progression of two separate models for a car wash business are provided: `simpleCarWash` and then `carWash`. 
The `simpleCarWash` has hard-coded wash bays, while `carWash` has wash bays as SST subcomponents and thus can be reconfigured.

Also provided in this directory is a discussion on how to get from a scenario with a business question to a Discrete Event Simulation model that uses SST capabilities.
